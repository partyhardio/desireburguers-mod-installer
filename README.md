## 💻 Requirements

- Node.js 18+ (duh~)

cd desireburguers-mod-installer
```

2. Install my fabulous dependencies:

```bash

## 📦 Build me into something... delicious 💖

Run this to make the installer:

## 🧸 Mod Folder Structure (keep it cute, babe~)

```lua
mods/
├── bikini/

Each mod has its own folder. Just drop in your sexy assets and make sure there’s a lil’ `mod.json` telling me who you are 💋
